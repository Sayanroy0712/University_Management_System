# University Management System using Java

Java is an Object-Oriented Language which makes it versatile and widely-used programming language known for its platform independence and robustness. Developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle), Java's key feature is its "write once, run anywhere" capability, enabled by its bytecode compilation and virtual machine technology. It has a rich ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and tools that facilitate the creation of diverse applications, from desktop software to web applications and mobile apps. Java's emphasis on object-oriented programming, strong typing, and memory management through garbage collection contributes to its reliability and scalability. The language's popularity, extensive documentation, and active community make it a popular choice for both novice and experienced developers, ensuring its continued relevance in the ever-evolving software development landscape.

This Java project focuses on developing a comprehensive University Management System, aimed at streamlining and enhancing the administrative and academic processes within a university. Leveraging the power of Java's object-oriented programming, this project has been designed as a user-friendly interface that allows administrators, faculty, and students to efficiently manage tasks such as course registration, grading, attendance tracking, and resource allocation. The system will incorporate a secure authentication system and database integration to provide real-time insights into various university operations. By implementing this project, I aim to contribute to the efficient management of educational institutions while honing my skills in Java programming, database management, and software design.

The softwares that I have used in this project are Netbeans and MySQL Workbench. The source code, icons, external libraries and database file has been provided in the repository.
